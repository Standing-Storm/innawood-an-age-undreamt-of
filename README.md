# Innawood: In an Age Undreamt Of
My attempt to make a stone age fantasy setting out of Innawood, using more base-CDDA-game content so I don't burn out trying to make everything from scratch like I did with [Mystical Innawood](https://github.com/Standing-Storm/mystical-innawood) (a lot of the content of which is in base-game CDDA now anyway). 

Note that if you enjoy the "make literally *everything* from scratch" part of Innawood, this is going to impinge on that. It's hard to have ancient tombs, prehuman ruins, humanlike enemies in the forest, etc., without giving them at least some kind of loot that you can take from them. 

Current features:
- Deduction becomes Occult: autolearn alchemical recipes, study the natural world, and learn the secrets of thaumaturgy.
- Explore haunted caves, lizardfolk lairs, mysterious standing stones, and villages with strangely-off inhabitants.
- Start as a wise one who knows the secrets of hedge magic; one of the elemental fae, newly-born in a primaeval world; or someone changed by the power of the Nether.
- Mutation: traits allow those who take them (or gain them later in the game) to mutate with exposure to portal storms.
- Enemies possessed of eldritch might. The elder races know secrets of sorcery far beyond the pitiful fumblings of humanity. 

Requires Xedra Evolved, Megafauna, and Innawood.

Contains some content adapted from Magiclysm. The two mods are not incompatible, but using them together might be a little weird.
