# Innawood: Age Age Undreamt Of
My attempt to make a stone age fantasy setting out of Innawood, using more base-CDDA-game content so I don't burn out trying to make everything from scratch like I did with (Mystical Innawood)[https://github.com/Standing-Storm/mystical-innawood] (a lot of the content of which is in base-game CDDA now anyway). 

Note that if you enjoy the "make literally *everything* from scratch" part of Innawood, this is going to impinge on that. It's hard to have ancient tombs, prehuman ruins, humanlike enemies in the forest, etc., without giving them at least some kind of loot that you can take from them. 

Requires Xedra Evolved, Megafauna, (Innawood Feral Villages)[https://github.com/Standing-Storm/innawoods-feral-villages], and (Xedra Evolved/Innawoods Merge Patch)[https://github.com/Standing-Storm/ccda-xedra-evolved-innawoods].
